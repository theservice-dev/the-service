      **Git Commit Message Standards (Conventional Commits)**

      All commit messages must follow the Conventional Commits format:
      `<type>(<scope>): <short summary>`

      **Types:**
      - `feat`: A new feature
      - `fix`: A bug fix
      - `docs`: Documentation only changes
      - `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc)
      - `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
      - `perf`: A code change that improves performance
      - `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
      - `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries

      **Scope:**
      Optional noun describing the section of the codebase affected (e.g., `header`, `cart`, `api`, `styles`).

      **Summary:**
      Short, imperative description of the change (lower case, no period at end).

      **Body (Optional but Recommended):**
      Explain the "why" and "how" of the change. This is critical for AI agents to understand context.

      **Examples:**
      - `feat(cart): add ajax add-to-cart functionality`
      - `fix(nav): correct z-index overlap on mobile menu`
      - `refactor(schema): standardize block settings naming`
      - `docs: update AGENTS.md with commit standards`
