# Menu Structure Setup Plan

This plan details the steps to configure your Shopify store's navigation to match the requested structure.

## 1. Main Navigation (Header)

You need to create a nested menu structure in **Shopify Admin > Online Store > Navigation**.

1.  Find or create a menu (e.g., "Main Menu").
2.  Add the following items:
    *   **Catalog** (Link to: All Products or a specific collection)
        *   **Custom Blanks** (Link to: Collection "Custom Blanks")
    *   **Services** (Link to: Page "Services" or `#`)
        *   **DTG Printing** (Link to: Page "DTG Printing")
        *   **DTF Printing** (Link to: Page "DTF Printing")
        *   **Live Printing** (Link to: Page "Live Printing")
    *   **Support** (Link to: Page "Support" or `#`)
        *   **Return Policy** (Link to: Policy "Refund Policy")
        *   **Shipping Policy** (Link to: Policy "Shipping Policy")
        *   **Privacy Policy** (Link to: Policy "Privacy Policy")
    *   **Contact Us** (Link to: Page "Contact")

## 2. Footer Navigation

You can create one or two menus for the footer.

### Option A: Two Separate Menus (Recommended)

1.  **Menu: Customer Care**
    *   **Return Policy**
    *   **Shipping Policy**
    *   **Privacy Policy**
    *   **How Billing Works** (Page)
    *   **Terms of Service** (Policy)
    *   **Intellectual Property Policy** (Page/Policy)

2.  **Menu: Company**
    *   **About Us** (Page)
    *   **Careers** (Page)
    *   **FAQs** (Page)
    *   **Contact Us** (Page)
    *   **Print-Ready File Guide** (Page)

## 3. User Account & Social

We have updated the **Account Drawer** to include links to your Cart and Social Media profiles.

### Configuration
1.  **Social Media**: Go to **Theme Settings > Social media** and enter your profile URLs for Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, and Twitter.
2.  **Account**: The "Account" drawer will now automatically show:
    *   **Log in / Create Account** (if logged out)
    *   **Orders** (if logged in)
    *   **Profile** (if logged in)
    *   **Bag/Cart** (New link added)
    *   **Social Icons** (New section added at the bottom)

## 4. Theme Configuration

Ensure your theme is pointing to these menus:
*   **Header**: Click on the Header section, check the "Menu" setting is set to "Main Menu".
*   **Footer**: Click on the Footer section, add blocks for "Menu" and select "Customer Care" and "Company" respectively.
